Historical changelog entries before this reset branch are preserved by tag
`pre-fixed-dag-reset-20260604-1457`.

## 2026-06-04 - Phase R1-B fixed DAG runtime protocol skeleton

### Added

- Added `src/react_agent/fixed_dag_contracts.py` with deterministic reset
  contracts and `workflow_snapshot_v2` builder.
- Added fixed-DAG parser tests, contract tests, graph skeleton tests, and public
  workflow v2 tests.

### Changed

- Replaced active `src/react_agent/graph.py` routing with the deterministic
  skeleton:
  `route_planner -> prepare_l1_context -> run_l2_conclusions ->
  run_dimension_composites -> decision_synthesizer -> report_generator ->
  final_emit -> memory_update`.
- Changed router prompt/parser surfaces from old route-mode planning to
  `fixed_dag_plan_v1`.
- Changed Python public workflow contracts from layer/mode/fusion fields to DAG
  stages, steps, dimension groups, provenance, and `reset_skeleton` final source.
- Updated reset docs to describe R1-B runtime scope and non-claims.

### Not Done

- No real business agent implementation.
- No provider, search, or external live verification.
- No frontend v2 workflow rewrite.
- No production deployment hardening.
- No mainline or fusion-gate artifact-writing validation.
